### $ Terms for Participation
All information provided to establish an account must be true and correct. You are responsible for keeping such information up-to-date. Failure to keep your account up-to-date may, among other things, jeopardize your eligibility for prizes.

You are solely responsible for keeping your account names and passwords confidential. You are responsible for activity that takes place under your account (including but not limited to activity that may affect your eligibility for prizes). If you believe that your account (or an account you have created on behalf of your child or a student) has been or may be compromised, you must notify TribeCTF by contacting the organizing committee as soon as possible.

If you register to be on a Team with other Participants, you understand that information about you may be provided to other Team Participants. In addition, you understand that your School may be informed about your participation in TribeCTF and/or may be asked to verify your enrollment in order to verify your eligibility to receive prizes. To the extent your School cannot legally release such information about you without your consent and you do not provide such consent, you agree that you and/or your Team may be ineligible for certain prizes if TribeCTF cannot verify your eligibility.

### $ Eligibility/Team Formation
While you can participate as an individual, team may be formed of upto 4 total participants, who may or may not be from the same institution. While there are no limitations on the resources or tools that Participants can use, only the eligible Team Participants may solve challenges as part of the Competition. Team advisors, or anyone outside the Team, may not provide direct assistance on any problems.

Teams may not interfere with the progress of other Teams, nor with the operation of the Competition’s infrastructure. More specifically, attacking the scoring server, other Teams, or machines not explicitly designated as targets is cheating. This includes both breaking into such machines, and denying others access to them or the ability to solve problems (for example, by altering a key or ping-flooding). Sharing keys or providing hints with other teams is cheating, as is being directly assisted by personnel outside the Team (using tools from the internet is OK; asking people on the internet to help solve the problem is not). We encourage Participants to solve problems in novel and creative ways using all available resources, but we do require that Participants solve the problems themselves.

At any time, in the sole and absolute discretion of TribeCTF, TribeCTF shall be entitled to disqualify a Participant and/or Team in the event of a failure to meet relevant eligibility criteria or any other violation or suspected violation of these Competition Rules and/or any Terms of Use (including but not limited to cheating). In the event of a Participant’s disqualification, TribeCTF may also notify the Participant’s School.

TribeCTF will determine participation eligibility, declare winners (including but not limited to in the event of a tie), and award prizes in its sole and absolute discretion. You agree that such decisions are final and are not subject to review or reconsideration and that Teams are not entitled to be informed of other Teams’ results.

TribeCTF reserves the right to verify the identity and eligibility of all Participants and Teams at any time. Without limiting the general nature of the prior sentence, prior to (and as a condition of) awarding any prizes, you agree that TribeCTF in its sole and absolute discretion may require additional paperwork to be executed by the relevant Participants. This information could include, among other things, written verification of parental consent (if applicable), verification of information needed to confirm eligibility or compliance with these Competition Rules and/or the Terms of Use, and information needed to facilitate the provision of prizes, and all paperwork requested by TribeCTF to enable it to comply with all applicable state, federal and local tax reporting (which may require the provision of social security numbers or other personal information as needed). All paperwork must be returned within seven (7) days of the date provided by TribeCTF (or such other date specified by TribeCTF). All prizes will be net of any taxes that TribeCTF is required by law to withhold. To the extent permitted by law, all taxes imposed on prizes are the sole responsibility of the winners. If a potential winner fails to provide such documentation within the timeframe required or fails to comply with such laws, the prize may be forfeited and TribeCTF may, in its discretion, select an alternate potential winner.


Anyone employed now or previously in ManTech is not eligible to participate in TribeCTF. This restriction is in place to ensure fair competition and avoid any potential conflicts of interest.

### $ Points/Determining Winners/Score Cards

TribeCTF may display one or more Competition leaderboards and/or scoreboards. These boards may be available to other Participants and/or the public, and may show the Team name, and/or school identified by the Team leader, and/or the name of the School identified by the Team leader.


### $ Awards
For any cash prizes awarded to a Team involving more than one Participant, each Participant shall be awarded an equal share of such prize, which shall be paid in United States dollars. William & Mary may, in its sole discretion, condition the payment of some or all of the winning Team’s cash prize on the Team attending the event at William & Mary.

Any prizes awarded are non-transferable, and any non-cash prizes are not exchangeable for cash. TribeCTF’s ability to offer any and all prizes is subject to applicable laws and regulations.
