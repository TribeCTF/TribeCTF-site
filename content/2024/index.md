## $ Highlights


TribeCTF 2024 was a resounding success. Over three days, 33 teams (70 participants) from four schools, namely William & Mary, George Mason University, Virginia Tech, and the University of Virginia, competed to solve 16 cybersecurity challenges in forensics, cryptography, reverse engineering, and coding. The teams worked all night on the 4th and the 5th, fiercely competing to solve as many challenges as possible and capture the most flags before anyone else.

Ultimately, a two-person team from W&M, composed of undergraduate students Luna Harrison (luna) and Walker Knapp (wtknapp), won first place (and the $5,000 prize). Luna and Walker solved all but one challenge and scored 6450/7450 points. A team from GMU (Mason Competitive Cyber), consisting of students Tanner Laventry (Txnner), Jax Dunfee (jjj), Sanskar Pokharel (sans), and Nicholas Stormer (salochi) won second place ($3,000 prize), solving 14/16 challenges and securing 5950/7450 points. Another two-person team from W&M consisting of undergraduates Celia Schaefers (CeliaS) and Zachary Bowden (lexzach) closely followed with 5650/7450 points by solving 13/16 challenges, securing third place and a prize of $1,000. Five other teams that ranked from 4th – 8th also received an honorable mention.
